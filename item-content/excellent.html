    Crafted a logo and business card design for Professional Writing Services called Excellent Writers.<br/><br/>
    Later the client ask for other language version, Chinese and Korean to be specific, which thrilled me as I adopt the final design. Multilingual designs are challenging because supporting different characters can give limitations.<br/><br/>
    However, it ended up executed successfully which made the design consistent.
