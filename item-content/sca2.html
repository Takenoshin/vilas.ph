		Simplify Cloud Accounting is a startup back office and accounting solutions working with hundreds of corporation across the globe.<br/>
		The company is looking for a futuristic, modern, and unique identity. It was challenging due to the company name is quite long and I never had experience and don't have much ideas regarding the company industry.
		So I had to gather information both online and offline to make a perfect identity.
