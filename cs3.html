		<h1>The Context</h1>
		<div class="case-study">
			<div style="padding:1em; text-align: left;">
				<p>
					In 2019, I was personally recruited by Austin Walper, a startup founder preparing to launch an esports engagement platform called PLAYR.gg. 
					<br><br>
					The company was in its early seed stage with no design foundation, brand identity, or product visuals. It started with just a business idea and ambition.
					<br><br>
					Austin was looking for a design partner who could move quickly, think strategically, and manage both product and creative work. That’s where I came in.		</p>

		<!-- <h1>Reflections</h1>
		<div class="case-study">
			<div style="border:1px solid #786fc7;background: #25223d; padding:1em;">
				<p>This experience shaped how I approach early-stage product strategy. I learned how design needs to be both tactical and strategic. MVP design is all about tradeoff thinking, and strong brand storytelling can make a big impact during fundraising. It also showed me the value of building design systems early to help scale faster without bottlenecks.</p>
