		<h1>The Context</h1>
		<div class="case-study">
			<div style="padding:1em; text-align: left;">
				<p>
					In 2019, I was personally recruited by Austin Walper, a startup founder preparing to launch an esports engagement platform called PLAYR.gg. The company was still in its early seed stage, with no design foundation, no brand identity, and no product visuals — just a business idea and ambition.
					<br><br>
					Austin needed a design partner who could move fast, think strategically, and wear multiple hats across product and creative — and that’s where I came in.

		<!-- <h1>Reflections</h1>
		<div class="case-study">
			<div style="border:1px solid #786fc7;background: #25223d; padding:1em;">
				<p>This experience shaped how I approach early-stage product strategy. I learned how design needs to be both tactical and strategic. MVP design is all about tradeoff thinking, and strong brand storytelling can make a big impact during fundraising. It also showed me the value of building design systems early to help scale faster without bottlenecks.</p>
